# Job Mining Project

This project aims to develop a web application that can mine job postings from various job websites and provide insights into the job market trends and requirements. The application will use web scraping and natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information from job postings, such as job titles, descriptions, requirements, and salaries, and analyze them to identify common patterns and trends.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

- BeautifulSoup
- Selenium
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

You can install these libraries using pip, as follows:

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install selenium
pip install nltk
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
```

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the job mining application by running the `main.py` file. The application will prompt you to enter a job title and location, and it will then scrape job postings from various websites and provide insights into the job market trends and requirements.

## Project Structure
